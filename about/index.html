        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p> I'm a second year undergraduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology,
            studying Information Technology and Management. Born and raised in Chicago, I've
            decided to give back to my city by working at a non-profit organization for the
            past few months.  I have interests in Web and Software Development as well as
            Cyber Security, with a passion for creating technologies that will give users
            the best experiences possible.
